# Quick Start

To quickly get started on Chainflip, there are multiple scenarios possible.

## Ideal Scenario

### 1. A little bit of background

To get you in the best position to work with Chainflip it is useful to have a little bit of knowledge on how the system works. Take a look at the following to understand the moving parts:

* [Introduction on how swapping works](../how-swapping-works)
* [The power of deposit channels](../../concepts/swaps-amm/deposit-channels-and-brokers)
* [The role of the broker, and how to earn fees](running-a-broker/introduction)

### 2. Prepare your Chainflip Account

The first practical step to get started is to get your Chainflip Account up and running. In order to do this you need to:

* [Create a Chainflip Account](chainflip-account/creating)
* [Fund it with some FLIP](chainflip-account/funding) (10 FLIP)
* [Register your Account as a Broker](chainflip-account/broker)

### 3. Setup a Broker

Once you have your Broker account, it's time to get the Broker API running in order to communicate with the Chainflip network. There are two main ways to do this:

* [Operate a Node and Broker API yourself](running-a-broker/broker-api)
* [Utilize a Broker API Provider](running-a-broker/affiliate-brokers)

### 4. Use the JS SDK & open a deposit channel

Now that you have a running Broker API, you are ready to use our [Javascript SDK](javascript-sdk/introduction):

* [Point to your broker and set a commission](javascript-sdk/quick-start#set-up)
* [Request a deposit address](javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address)

### 5. Swap!

After having opened a deposit channel and having requested a deposit address, it is time to send funds to the deposit address and [watch the Chainflip magic happen!](../../concepts/swaps-amm/native-swap-flow)

## Quick Scenario

<Callout type="warning">
The quick scenario is useful for a development environment. **It is not advised for production**!
</Callout>

A faster way to start developing is by swapping via the main Chainflip Broker. This **prevents you from earning any fees** and is subject to imposed rate limits.


### 1. Use the JS SDK & open a deposit channel

Now that you have a running Broker API, you are ready to use our [Javascript SDK](javascript-sdk/introduction):

* [Set up the SDK with the default options](javascript-sdk/quick-start#set-up)
* [Request a deposit address](javascript-sdk/swap-assets/request-deposit-address)

### 2. Swap!

After having opened a deposit channel and having requested a deposit address, it is time to send funds to the deposit address and [watch the Chainflip magic happen!](../../concepts/swaps-amm/native-swap-flow)
